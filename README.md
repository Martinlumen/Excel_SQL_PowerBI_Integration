# WHO Data Analysis on COVID-19 (2019)

## Description
This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 data from the World Health Organization (WHO), focusing on the recorded cases in 2019. The analysis is conducted using a combination of **Excel** for data manipulation, **SQL** for database querying, and **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation.

The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights from the WHO dataset and showcase the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally through interactive reports and visualizations.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, transformation, and initial analysis.
- **SQL**: Writing queries to analyze data from a relational database.
- **Power BI**: Creating interactive visual reports and dashboards.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the WHO COVID-19 dataset.
- `sql_queries/`: SQL queries used for data analysis.
- `power_bi_report/`: Power BI report file (`.pbix`) containing the dashboards.
- `excel_analysis/`: Excel workbook with data cleaning and preliminary analysis.

## Usage

### Prerequisites:
1. **SQL Database**: To run the SQL scripts, ensure you have a working SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. **Power BI Desktop**: Install Power BI Desktop to open the `.pbix` file and view the dashboards.

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
